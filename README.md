We design a multiphase Biot equation for three-dimensional poroelastic wave equations adapted to half-precision data types (BEHF). Furthermore, we design a heterogeneous parallel optimization method (MPFlow) for BEHF in the form of a workflow that minimizes the data transfer latency for general-purpose computations on graphics processing units and enables the overlap of communication and computation.

System requirement
To ensure that the program runs smoothly, please meet the following system configuration requirements:

- Operating System: Linux
- Compiler: C/C++ compiler (e.g., gcc, clang)
- CUDA Toolkit: Version 11.7 or higher
- MPI Library: Open MPI 4.0 or higher with CUDA-Aware support
- Graphics card: NVIDIA A 100 or higher performance graphics card

Run the Project
make
mpirun -n a ./xxx (a is the number of mpi processes, xxx is the executable file generated by your make)
